                    <p>Created a Spotify clone, that looks exactly like the Spotify app, but displays the song lyrics instead. Implemented in Angular + Ionic with integration of an external Musixmatch API. Learned extensive use of the RxJS library for reactively fetching search queries and lyrics. Lazy loaded components to improve initial load times for the application. Created a responsive design to support tablets and browsers.
